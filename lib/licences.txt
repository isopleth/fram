These libraries are not part of Fram, but are used by it. They are
provided as a convenience so you don't have to go searching for them.
However, they are not covered by the software licence for Fram but
instead have their own licences. There are different versions of all
these licenses, so look in the package URL for the specific versions.

These are:

package                   Licence   URL of package
